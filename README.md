- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Andrew-Knoeller


I am currently in my second semester at Blue Ridge Community and Technical college earning my Associates of applied science in software engineering.
My current GPA is 3.75 and I've earned 15 out of my 60 required credits. This semester I am taking another 16 credit hours so I will be halfway done my degree at the end of this semester
I have been interested in software engineering for about 6-7 years and have done some self-teaching but this college course is the first real education I am getting for the field.
I am learning Python and C# mostly at this moment. I also know some HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Next semester I am on board to also learn Java.

If anyone has any projects or anything they would allow me to help with, I'd love to collaborate and further some of my skills in a real world enviroment! I am willing to work for just
the experience. I could also help to debug or test any programs or applications if you need someone!

You can contact me with any requests, advice or anything really at andrew.knoeller10590@gmail.com
