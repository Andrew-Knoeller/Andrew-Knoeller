- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Andrew-Knoeller

Take a break, leave a comment, critique or give friendly criticism for any parts of my code. I love getting advice from people more experienced. Never will be insulted by someone showing me a better way to do something. Most of these projects arent my best work but I just honestly am lazy and need to clean up repos and upload my best projects. 

Also anyone with ideas for good coding projects, please give me your thoughts. I have a huge list of little things but I am craving a hard challenging project. Just have a lack of good ideas or imaginAAAAtion {spongebob}. Any beginners that would like help or to group up for a project feel free to email me as well. I will pass down any knowledge I can and help with school projects. {Keyword HELP, cannot do your finals for you because you will need to learn on your journey, Ill guide you anytime though} 

You can contact me with any requests, advice or anything really at andrew.knoeller10590@gmail.com
